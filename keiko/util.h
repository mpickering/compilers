/* Auto-grow buffers */

/*
To declare an autogrow buffer called A with size N and elements 
of type T, say:

     PRIVATE growdecl(A);
     #define A growbuf(A, T)
     #define N growsize(A)

Remarkably, the macro madness (which appears to define A recursively)
all works out fine.

To initialize the buffer:

     buf_init(A, init_size, margin, T, "the array A")

The message "Couldn't allocate space for the array A" will be printed
if allocation fails.

To check that at least |margin| elements remain unused:

     buf_grow(A)
